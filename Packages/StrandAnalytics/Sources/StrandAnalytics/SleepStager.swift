// SleepStager.swift — sleep/wake detection + APPROXIMATE 4-class staging.
//
// Ported from server/ingest/app/analysis/sleep.py and sleep_features.py.
//
// HONEST HEDGING: these stages are APPROXIMATIONS, not PSG-validated, not medical
// advice. The EEG-free 4-class ceiling is ~65–73% epoch agreement (Walch 2019).
// Light/deep separation is the weakest link — deep-minute estimates are the least
// reliable output.
//
// Pipeline (30 s epochs):
//   Stage 0  gravity-stillness sleep/wake spine → in-bed sessions. Cole–Kripke
//            (te Lindert 30 s) computed as a citable cross-check; HR confirms runs.
//   Stage 1  per-epoch cardiorespiratory features over a rolling 5-min window
//            (mean HR, DoG-HR variability, RMSSD/SDNN from RR, resp rate + RRV).
//   Stage 2  transparent percentile-band classifier → {wake, light, deep, rem}.
//   Stage 3  median smoothing + physiology re-imposition (no early REM, deep in
//            the first third of the night).
//
// NOTE: the Python source computes RMSSD/SDNN/HF/LF/LFHF via neurokit2 per epoch.
// On-device we have no neurokit2/scipy, so frequency-domain features (HF, LF/HF)
// are omitted and the parasympathetic-tone signal is RMSSD only. Respiration rate
// + RRV are derived from the raw 1 Hz resp channel with a simple peak detector
// (the Python source explicitly derives these "robustly ourselves" too, so this
// path is a faithful port rather than an approximation). The classifier seam,
// percentile bands, smoothing, and physiology rules are reproduced exactly.

// WatchRecovery.swift — recovery/Charge from Apple Watch DAILY aggregates.
//
// The honesty-critical piece of "Apple Watch as a device". A WHOOP strap gives us
// dense overnight RR intervals, so RecoveryScorer runs off raw-derived nightly RMSSD.
// The Apple Watch does NOT. It gives a handful of HRV SDNN readings a day plus a
// resting HR, both as daily aggregates. So watch recovery is a genuinely lower-density
// computation.
//
// We do NOT invent a new formula. Recovery is HRV-and-RHR-vs-personal-baseline, and
// because every term is relative to the person's OWN baseline, the metric scale cancels
// out: SDNN-vs-SDNN-baseline behaves like RMSSD-vs-RMSSD-baseline. So we build SDNN and
// RHR baselines through the existing `Baselines` machinery and feed them straight into
// the SAME `RecoveryScorer.recovery(...)` the strap uses. Watch recovery and strap
// recovery therefore land on the same 0-100 scale and read against the same bands.
//
// What we drop vs the strap path: the respiration, sleep-performance and skin-temp terms
// are not supplied here (the watch's daily aggregate doesn't carry them in the same shape),
// so RecoveryScorer renormalises the remaining HRV + RHR weights. The HRV term stays the
// dominant driver either way.
//
// The hard honesty rule: we return nil recovery + `.calibrating` when today's SDNN is
// missing, OR the SDNN baseline isn't usable yet, OR we have fewer than `minBaselineNights`
// nights of history. We NEVER fabricate a number to fill a sparse week. Confidence comes
// straight from the existing `ScoreConfidence.charge(recovery:hrvBaseline:)`, so the watch
// "calibrating → building → solid" arc is the same one the strap uses.

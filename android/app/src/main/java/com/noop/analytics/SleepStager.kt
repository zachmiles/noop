/*
 * SleepStager.kt — sleep/wake detection + APPROXIMATE 4-class staging.
 *
 * Faithful Kotlin port of StrandAnalytics/SleepStager.swift (verified on macOS),
 * itself ported from server/ingest/app/analysis/sleep.py and sleep_features.py.
 *
 * HONEST HEDGING: these stages are APPROXIMATIONS, not PSG-validated, not medical
 * advice. The EEG-free 4-class ceiling is ~65–73% epoch agreement (Walch 2019).
 * Light/deep separation is the weakest link — deep-minute estimates are the least
 * reliable output.
 *
 * Pipeline (30 s epochs):
 *   Stage 0  gravity-stillness sleep/wake spine → in-bed sessions. Cole–Kripke
 *            (te Lindert 30 s) computed as a citable cross-check; HR confirms runs.
 *   Stage 1  per-epoch cardiorespiratory features over a rolling 5-min window
 *            (mean HR, DoG-HR variability, RMSSD/SDNN from RR, resp rate + RRV).
 *   Stage 2  transparent percentile-band classifier → {wake, light, deep, rem}.
 *   Stage 3  median smoothing + physiology re-imposition (no early REM, deep in
 *            the first third of the night).
 *
 * NOTE: frequency-domain HRV features (HF, LF/HF) are omitted (no neurokit2/scipy
 * on-device); the parasympathetic-tone signal is RMSSD only. Respiration rate +
 * RRV are derived from the raw 1 Hz resp channel with a simple peak detector. The
 * classifier seam, percentile bands, smoothing, and physiology rules are
 * reproduced exactly.
 *
 * Types:
 *   - The detected-sleep type is [DetectedSleep] (AnalyticsModels.kt), NOT a Room
 *     entity. Stage segments are [StageSegment] (AnalyticsModels.kt, fields var).
 *   - [HypnogramMetrics] (AnalyticsModels.kt) is returned by [hypnogramMetrics].
 *
 * All `ts` / `start` / `end` are wall-clock unix SECONDS (Long); the Swift source
 * uses Int seconds. Math is done in Double throughout, matching the Swift port.

/**
 * Immutable snapshot of the live connection + biometric state.
 *
 * Direct port of Strand's `LiveState` (Strand/BLE/LiveState.swift), reduced to the fields the
 * Android UI consumes. Where the Swift app used an `@Published` ObservableObject with closures
 * (`onDoubleTap`, `onWristChange`), the Android port surfaces the most-recent physical input through
 * [lastEvent] and exposes wrist-wear through [worn]; the ViewModel reacts to changes in this flow.
 *
 *  - [connected]   GATT connection is up (CBPeripheral didConnect)
 *  - [bonded]      one confirmed write to the command char has been ACKed (the WHOOP "bond")
 *  - [heartRate]   most-recent plausible BPM (30..220) from the standard 0x2A37 profile OR the
 *                  custom REALTIME_DATA frame
 *  - [rr]          most-recent R-R intervals (ms); the standard profile is the reliable source
 *  - [batteryPct]  battery percent — 5/MG: 0x2A19 whole %; WHOOP 4: GET_BATTERY_LEVEL response u16/10
 *                  (the 4.0's 0x2A19 is a stub constant 100 and is ignored, #77)
 *  - [worn]        wrist-wear from WRIST_ON/WRIST_OFF events; defaults true (Swift parity) so
 *                  wear-gated features work before the first event lands
 *  - [lastEvent]   the most-recent strap EVENT string ("WRIST_ON(9)", "DOUBLE_TAP(14)", …)

 *      (one confirmed write of GET_BATTERY_LEVEL); subscribe to the three custom notify chars + the
 *      standard HR and battery chars (didDiscoverCharacteristicsFor).
 *   5. onCharacteristicWrite — the confirmed-write ACK == bonding succeeded; run the connect
 *      handshake EXACTLY ONCE (didWriteValueFor + connectHandshakeDone guard).
 *   6. onCharacteristicChanged — route inbound bytes (didUpdateValueFor):
 *        • HR char (0x2A37)      → parse standard HR + R-R
 *        • battery char (0x2A19) → first byte = percent

 *   - On API <= 30, BLUETOOTH + BLUETOOTH_ADMIN are install-time, but a coarse/fine LOCATION
 *     runtime permission is required for BLE *scanning* to return results.
 *   - Declaring `android:usesPermissionFlags="neverForLocation"` on BLUETOOTH_SCAN lets you skip
 *     the location grant on API 31+ (we filter by service UUID, never deriving location).
 *   - Every android.bluetooth call below is annotated @SuppressLint("MissingPermission"); the

     *     too). We still surface these as a diagnostic, but as what they are — another client's backlog
     *     reaching us over the shared notify channel — not a live R22 "unlock".

/**
 * Historical-offload state machine (idle / backfilling).
 *
 * Direct port of the macOS Swift `Backfiller` (Strand/Collect/Backfiller.swift). It consumes the
 * METADATA frames of an offload — HISTORY_START / repeated HISTORY_END / HISTORY_COMPLETE —
 * accumulating the type-47 records between them into chunks and committing each chunk durably.
 *
 * Per-chunk local safe-trim invariant (unchanged from Swift):
 *   decode known -> persist decoded (durable) -> persist the strap_trim cursor -> ack the trim to
 *   the strap (link-layer confirmed write).
 * A chunk is forgotten by the strap only after its decoded rows are locally durable AND the trim
 * cursor is persisted AND the ack write is confirmed. The phone NEVER waits on a server (there is
 * none — Strand is fully on-device).
 *
 * CRITICAL behaviour preserved from Swift: a high-freq-sync offload sends ONE HISTORY_START then
 * REPEATED HISTORY_ENDs (a chunk-close every ~50 records). So we ack EVERY end and keep
 * accumulating afterwards — we snapshot+clear the accumulated frames on each END but leave the
 * chunk OPEN so subsequent records become the next chunk. An END with no accumulated records is
 * still acked (it advances the strap's trim) — that is how the offload progresses.
 *
 * CONCURRENCY: [ingest] is `suspend` and serialised by [mutex] so START/data/END chunk assembly is
 * never reordered, matching the Swift serial-drain task. The owning [WhoopBleClient] feeds frames
 * in arrival order from a single drain coroutine.
 *
 * RAW CAPTURE: the Swift Backfiller optionally persists ALL raw frames (research toggle, default OFF);
 * the Android data layer has no raw-frame outbox table, so that bulk capture is intentionally omitted
 * here — decoded rows are the product of record and are still durably committed before the trim is
 * advanced, exactly as in the Swift default (raw-off) configuration. The ONE exception is the
 * undecodable-record archive (#77 / #91): record frames that fail decode are persisted via
 * [rejectedSink] BEFORE the trim is acked, because the strap frees acked history and those bytes would
 * otherwise be the user's permanently-lost only copy. See the FLAG in the port notes.

 * the Room schema or the build/manifest.
 *
 * FLAG (uncertain / divergence from macOS): on the Swift side the cursor lives in the same SQLite
 * file as the decoded rows, so cursor and rows commit/back-up atomically together. Here the cursor
 * lives in SharedPreferences, separate from the Room DB. The safe-trim ORDERING is preserved
 * (decoded rows are inserted and durable before the cursor is written, and the cursor is written
 * before the ack), so the worst case is a redundant re-offload of an already-stored chunk after a
 * crash — never data loss — because the decoded inserts are idempotent by natural key. If a Room
 * `cursor` table is later added, swap this implementation for a DAO-backed one.

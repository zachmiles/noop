//   (a) a sleep band shading the night's sleep span (indigo, behind the line conceptually but
//       drawn under the marker chrome so labels stay legible),
//   (b) a dashed Charge rule + label at wake time (sleep end), hidden while recovery calibrates,
//   (c) a dashed Effort rule + label at "now" (the latest sample), routed through the SAME
//       UnitFormatter.effortDisplay the Effort tile uses so it honours the 0–100 / 0–21 toggle (#268),
//   (d) a small sport glyph at each workout's in-window HR peak.
//
// LineChart plots points by LIST INDEX (evenly spaced, no time axis), so each marker's wall-clock
// time is mapped to a fractional list index by interpolating against the buckets' own timestamps —
// markers then sit exactly on the rendered curve even when the strap history has gaps. Every layer
// self-hides when its data is absent (no sleep, calibrating Charge, no workouts). Mirrors the macOS
// OverviewHRChart (Packages/StrandDesign) in NOOP's own colour language. (PR #285)

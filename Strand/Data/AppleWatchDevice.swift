// Registers the Apple Watch in the same `DeviceRegistry` as every strap, feeding the existing
// `apple-health` source. There is no special-casing in the Devices screen: once this upserts the
// row, it renders through the normal `ForEach` over the registry like any other device.
//
// HONESTY is the whole point. The capability set is TRIMMED to the metrics that have actually
// arrived from HealthKit, not the full theoretical set. So a Series 6 (no wrist temp) reads without
// a "Skin temp" claim, and a newest US unit (SpO2 dropped) reads without "Blood oxygen". We never
// advertise a sensor the user's watch hasn't produced a single sample from.
//
// Apple-only by design (no Android twin). The file lives in shared `Strand/Data/` so the pure
// capability-derivation logic is testable on macOS too, but the live HealthKit read that decides
// `authorized` is supplied by the iOS bridge (`HealthKitBridge`), kept out of here so this stays
// platform-neutral and unit-testable without HealthKit.

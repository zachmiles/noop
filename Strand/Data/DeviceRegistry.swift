// Observable @MainActor cache over the synchronous `DeviceRegistryStore` (device-foundation
// Task 5). The UI observes this for the paired-device list + the currently active device; the
// app's `deviceId` is sourced from `activeDeviceId` so it's "the active device's id" rather than
// the hardcoded "my-whoop" literal. Behaviour is unchanged today — migration v15 seeds a single
// 'my-whoop' row as `.active`, so the active id is still "my-whoop".
//
// `DeviceRegistryStore` is synchronous (its own GRDB queue, internally serialized), so the reads
// here are plain synchronous calls; we keep failures non-fatal and fall back to the seeded defaults.

// API key for a provider they choose, NOOP can send a compact text summary of their metrics plus
// their question to that provider and surface coaching advice. Nothing leaves the device until a
// key is set AND a question is asked. We never embed our own key, never auto-send, and only ever
// transmit the small text context built in `buildContext()` + the running chat — no raw streams.
//
// Pure macOS: Foundation + URLSession + Security (Keychain). Compiles on macOS 13, Swift 5.
// Provider wire formats live in Providers/: OpenAI.swift, Anthropic.swift, Gemini.swift.

    Coach using autoregulation:

    34–66 = maintain, quality over volume, keep it controlled; 0–33 = active recovery only \
    (Zone 2, mobility, extra sleep) and protect against accumulating effort debt.
    • Workout optimisation: progressive overload, polarised ~80/20 intensity, space hard sessions, \
    program deloads/periodisation, and treat sleep as the single biggest recovery lever.
    • Always cite the user's ACTUAL numbers, give a concrete plan (today and the week ahead), and \
    be specific, punchy and motivating — like a coach who knows them.

// MARK: - Insights

// The headline "interrogate what affects what" screen. Two halves:
//
//  1. BEHAVIOUR EFFECTS — split your logged journal answers (Alcohol, Caffeine,
//     Late meal, Meditation…) into the days each behaviour WAS logged vs NOT, then
//     compare a chosen outcome metric (Recovery / HRV / Sleep performance / RHR)
//     between the two groups. Ranked by effect size (Cohen's d) with significant
//     effects first; each card carries the plain-English sentence, the with/without
//     means, group counts, a significance pill, and the effect-size magnitude.
//     Tint is sign-aware: a behaviour that moves the outcome the "good" way
//     (respecting higherIsBetter) is positive/green, the "bad" way is critical/red.
//
//  2. METRIC RELATIONSHIPS — a curated set of Pearson correlations between daily
//     series (sleep ↔ recovery, today's strain ↔ next-day recovery via a 1-day lag,
//     HRV ↔ recovery, RHR ↔ recovery), each rendered as a one-line insight with r
//     and a plain-English reading of strength + direction.
//
// All math comes from StrandAnalytics (BehaviorInsights / CorrelationEngine); this
// view only loads the series, shapes them, and presents. Empty state via ComingSoon
// when there is no journal data to interrogate.

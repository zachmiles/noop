// MARK: - SleepView
//
// Whoop-sleep clarity on the locked Noop component system. Scannable in two seconds:
//   1. HERO ChartCard "Last night" — the stage breakdown (Hypnogram if intervals
//      reconstruct from stagesJSON, else a clean proportional stacked stage bar),
//      trailing = total asleep, footer = REM/Deep/Light/Awake each "Xh Ym · NN%".
//   2. A uniform grid of fixed StatTiles, each with a sparkline and a "vs typical"
//      caption: Performance, Efficiency, Consistency, Hours vs Needed, Restorative,
//      Respiratory, Sleep Debt.
//   2b. The sleep-debt LEDGER card — a rolling 14-night running balance of (slept −
//      personal need) with a plain-English read and a diverging per-night delta bar.
//   3. "Stages vs typical" NoopCard — Deep/REM/Light as horizontal bars, last-night
//      minutes with a marker at the personal typical (mean) so highs/lows pop.
//   4. A 30-day asleep-hours ChartCard trend.
//
// Every surface is a NoopCard / StatTile / ChartCard — no hand-sized cards, one grid,
// equal margins. Data wiring is preserved from the previous screen (stagesJSON =
// minutes for light/deep/rem/awake; typical = mean of repo.days).
